	 <h3><p>Hello, my name is Jeff Rosal. Being Born and Raised in Chicago,Il, I have always been interested in History and culture.  
	 While searching... curiously through the freshman college curriculum, I quickly got lost in the world of Anthropology. 
	 I grew up admiring artists and musicians. Where do these amazing ideas come from? why am I amazed? How could something so personal to someone else become so compelling to others? Anthropology helped me understand a little better but The greatest thing that I learned from studying anthropology is that we are doomed to repeat the past but its not a bad thing. We are the iterations of everyones past and every time we make contact with each other we share that culture with each other like a virus full of lineages.  While going to school I worked as a Computer specialist at a big corporation, my daily grind was building computers,filling out spread sheets and updating software through out the whole 20 story building, learning nothing new and emotionless like a Robot.  It was a great experience but it definitely was not as fullfilling as school. One day my boss asked me to drop out of school and sign up to a technical school to focus on computer science in hopes that one day I would share his office. I was young, working at a fulltime job, going to school fulltime, and making a lot of money that most people would quit school for.  I said that I wasnt interested. The next day my entrance Key card stopped working.  To me it was a valuable lesson, do what you love, because you dont want go through everyday at a job that bores you to the point where you stop caring and people start noticing.  After that experience I studied Creative Technology the best of all worlds, History, Culture, and Code!  </p><h3>
