	 <h3><p>Hello, my name is Jeffrey Rosal. Welcome to my new website. I was born and raised in Chicago.  While searching... curiously through my freshman college curriculum, I quickly got lost in the world of Anthropology. I was initially amazed at all the interesting ideas and sciences passed on through lineages. Learning so much about Technology, History and Culture, My interests slowly moved toward Getting a degree in ART and Design.  While in art school I began to gain a great appreciation to interactive art with circuit and code. Which led me to focus my studies on History and "Art and Technology".  After graduating I Worked as a freelance artist at Datamashmedia and a small Chicago production house as a creative in all kinds of media including Creative Writing, Web, Video, Sound and Photo. I am Currently working toward a career in UX/UI design because I love Culture and Code!
